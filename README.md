# Assignment_Internship
The project builds a robust machine learning model to assign a credit score between 0 and 1000 to each wallet based on their historical transaction behaviour on the Aave V2 protocol. The aim is to differentiate between a reliable and a risky wallet behaviour.

# Dataset
A dataset with a sample size of 100K raw transaction-level data was used, with each record corresponding to deposit, borrow, repay, redeemunderlying and liquidationcall. The data stored in "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ISFbAXxadMrt7Zl96rmzzZmEKZnyW7FS/view?usp=sharing" was downloaded and added to the Kaggle notebook "https://www.kaggle.com/code/sreekanthravikumar/assignment-internship".
